THE SUMMARY OF UNDERSTANDING OF ALGORITHMS SCHEDULING THE CPU TASKS:


The SJF ALGORITHM: 
------------------
SJF Stands for Shortest Job first. This Algorithm of Scheduling completes the tasks based on their lengths the task which 
can be done in the smallest time is done by the CPU and Similiary the tasks are done by the increasing order of their
time consumption. The task with the expectation of being done in the longest time among the tasks to be done is completed
at the end.


The FIFO ALGORITHM:
-------------------
FIFO Stands for First In First Out.As the name of the suggests in this algorithm: The task which reaches first to the cpu 
is done by the cpu. There is priority of expected time taken by the task. The task which reaches to the cpu at the end is 
processsed at the end despite of its time length or complexity.


The RR ALGORITHM:
-----------------
RR stands for Round Robin.Round Robin is the preemptive process scheduling algorithm. Each process is provided a fix time 
to execute, it is called a quantum. Once a process is executed for a given time period, it is preempted and other process 
executes for a given time period. Context switching is used to save states of preempted processes
